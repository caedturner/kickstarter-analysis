# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Looking into data from previously attempted kickstarters in search of insight for optimization of a Kickstarter. 

### Purpose
Help identify trends in prevoius Kickstarter campaigns in order to help direct decisions to benefit future decisions.

## Analysis and Challenges
We analyzed the start dates of all "Theatre" categories fundraising campaigns, and how the results varied based on the Kickstarters commenced.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Data shows that may was the most successful Kickstarter start date. 111 Kickstarters that started in may were successful and 52 failed Kickstarters.

Analysis confirms that December is the least Successful Kickstarter start date. In december there were 35 Failed Kickstarters and 37 Successful Kickstarters.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The Highest Percentage of success was found when the goal is less than $1000 (75.81%)
There are very few attempts to start a campaign with a goal of $20,000 or more. These campaigns overwhelmingly did poorly, but the $35,000 to $49,999 both had a 67.67% success rate, but they were comprised of very few campaigns.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Findings suggest that trying to start a campaign between September and March can yeild poor chances of success, as well as setting a goal above $5000.

## Results
Starting a campaign between May and August (May being the most successful month) with a goal less than or equal to $5000 will have the highest probability of success.


- Limitations of Dataset 
  - the data does not tell what the starting goals were successful by month. For example: since May is the most successful month does that mean that the larger goals were more successful here as well. 
  - A Pareto Graph showing the months percentage of success and month they were started would be a way we could further understand when we should begin a Kickstarter campaign as well as a reasonable goal. this information would allow us to optimize taking both variables into consideration, rather than each seprately.
